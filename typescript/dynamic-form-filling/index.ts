const tripDetails = `I'm planning a Summer in Japan. We're going to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka (Japan) for 14 days. There will be 2 of us, and our budget is around $3,500 USD. We have a couple of dietary needs: vegetarian, and no shellfish. For activities, we'd love food tours, historical sites and temples, nature/scenic walks, local markets, and generally an itinerary that's easy to do with public transit. For accommodation, we prefer mid-range hotels or a traditional ryokan. We like a relaxed pace, with maybe a few busier days mixed in. It's our first time in Japan, and we'd love help balancing must-see attractions with less touristy experiences, plus recommendations for vegetarian-friendly restaurants.`;
